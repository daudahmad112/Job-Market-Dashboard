Here's what I found from building a Job Market Dashboard of Pakistan.

âž¡ Top 03 Job Departments: IT, Computer Software, Web & E-Commerce.

âž¡ The highest job listings are with 0 years (Freshers, Students) - 1,864.

âž¡ ibex. Pakistan, SOFTNATION, HG Marketing have the most job listings.

Although, this data is for 2019-2021 but the quality is quite high. The next step would be to perform a similar data exploration on an updated dataset.

However, an interesting finding from this job data from Covid times is that 
although new job postings dipped during the initial Covid months of Feb to May 2020, the pattern repeated itself in 2021 i.e. job postings started dipping in Feb 2021.

(Perhaps, Covid didn't impact the number of job listings. ðŸ¤”)

My Biggest Challenge in building this dashboard in hashtag#Excel would be slicers. Adding slicers for a long list (for example, listing all cities instead of the top 03 cities with most jobs) simply didn't look feasible. 

My thanks to Zeeshan Usmani, Ph.D for making this data publicly available on Kaggle (Link: https://lnkd.in/dpJNvJhe).
